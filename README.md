### Downloads <br/>
[Download](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and install Visual Studio.<br/>
[Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and install the Postman App.<br/>
[Download](https://github.com/Julian-Arboleda/Hola.WebApi/archive/master.zip) the newest version of ¡HOLA! to a location you can remember.<br/>



### Getting Started<br/>
Drag and drop the Hola.WebApi-Master folder from the file you dowloaded to unzip it.<br/>
Double click the Hola.WebAPI.sln file inside the folder you just moved to launch the program using Visual Studio.<br/>
Now that you have the program open in Visual Studio, press the green Play button on the toolbar at the top.<br/>
A window should open that looks like this:<br/> ![First Web Page Run](https://i.imgur.com/7Zb2w7k.png "Finding Your Port") <br/>

Copy the information from your window that is in the same spot as the red box in the example.<br/>
Note that the information will likely not be the same as the example. <br/>
Using the Port information you just copied, you are now able to use the Postman App to test the API!<br/>
